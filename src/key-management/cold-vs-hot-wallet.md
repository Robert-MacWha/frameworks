# Cold vs Hot wallet
*TODO: Mention something about them having nothing to do with their technology per s√©, but more with
how you use them.*

Hot wallets and cold wallets are two primary methods for storing and managing
cryptocurrencies. A hot wallet is a software-based wallet that is connected to
the internet and is often used for regular transactions. On the other hand, a
cold wallet is a hardware device that stores the user's private keys offline,
providing enhanced security but lqss convenience for frequent transactions.

## Usage and Applications
Hot wallets are suitable for individuals who make regular cryptocurrency
transactions and require easy access to their funds. They are more user-friendly
and provide a smooth experience for crypto exchanges[^geeks]. Cold wallets, on the
other hand, are ideal for long-term storage of cryptocurrencies and for those
who make fewer transactions. They offer enhanced security benefits due to being
offline, making them less vulnerable to online hacks or theft[^nerd].

## Differences
The main differences between hot and cold wallets are their connectivity and
security features. Hot wallets are always connected to the internet, allowing
for easy accessibility but making them more vulnerable to hacking. Cold wallets,
being offline, provide a higher level of security but are less convenient for
frequent trading or transactions. In summary, the choice between a hot wallet
and a cold wallet depends on an individual's specific needs and preferences. Hot
wallets are more suitable for regular transactions, while cold wallets are
preferred for long-term storage and enhanced security. Some users may opt to use
a combination of both for a balance between accessibility and security[^gemini].
