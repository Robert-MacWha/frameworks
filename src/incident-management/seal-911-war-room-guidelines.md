# SEAL 911

SEAL 911 is a project designed to give users, developers, and even other security researchers an accessible method to contact a small group of highly trusted security researchers. The group can be reached via the [Telegram bot](https://t.me/seal_911_bot).

Members of SEAL 911 follow a strict [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/security-alliance/seal-911/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

When interacting with SEAL 911, ensure that you give as much information as possible in order to avoid double work by the security researchers.

## Actions Checklist

### Perform Immediately
1. Notify SEAL 911 Bot of the incident. Use this message template to get started.
2. Create a War Room with audio and share the invite link with trusted individuals.
3. Duplicate this document to allow collaboration and share the link in the War Room.
4. Review the Advice to Keep in Mind section.

### Perform in Parallel by Role
1. Assign Key Roles to War Room Members.
2. **Analysis**:
    - Scope the impact of the attack.
    - Gather Transactions Involved.
    - Gather Affected Addresses.
    - Record Funds Movement.
    - Gather Attacker Information.
    - Investigate the issue and update the Issue Description.
    - Propose workable solutions.
3. **Protocol actions**:
    - Take immediate corrective/preventative actions to prevent further loss of funds.
    - Pause contracts if possible.
    - Execute pre-made defensive scripts.
    - Prioritize proposed solutions.
    - Validate and execute the solution.
    - Prepare monitoring alerts for situations that require future actions.
4. **Web actions**:
    - Disable deposits and/or withdrawals as needed in the web UI.
    - Enable frontend IP or Address blacklisting.
    - Create frontend for any user actions necessary (approval revoking, fund migrating, etc.).
5. **Communications**:
    - Identify social platforms that communications on the incident must be sent to.
    - Prepare messages for incident communication internally and externally.
    - Gather security contacts for any potentially affected downstream protocols (bridges, lending protocols).
    - Notify block explorers (like Etherscan) for attacker address labeling.
    - Continuously monitor social media for users providing additional information that aids whitehat efforts.
    - Monitor War Room efforts and maintain the Event Timeline.

### After all of the above is complete, consider Post Incident Actions

## Information Gathering
Information will primarily be shared and acted upon in the War Room. As time allows, consolidate intel in the below section to achieve the following:
- Accurately scope the incident impact.
- Inform new War Room members and third parties efficiently.
- Aid external communication.

This is the chief duty of the Scribe.

### Issue Description
<Provide a description of the issue at hand>

### Events Timeline
Record events to construct an overall timeline of the incident. Events worth recording:
- First notice of the incident
- War room creation
- External communications
- Attack transactions
- Transactions performed by the team

Record times in UTC. Use a UTC Time Converter.

| Date-Time (UTC) | Event Description | Notes |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ----- |
|                 |                    |       |
|                 |                    |       |

|                 |                    |       |

### Transactions Involved
Record all transactions related to the incident.

| Transaction Link | Notes |
| ---------------- | ----- |
|                  |       |
|                  |       |
|                  |       |

### Affected Addresses
Record affected addresses related to the incident (protocol contracts, bridges, users, etc.).

| Address Link | Status | Notes |
| ------------ | ------ | ----- |
|              | At Risk|       |
|              | Impacted |     |
|              | Paused  |      |
|              | Saved   |      |
|              | Needs Review | |
|              | Uncertain |   |

### Funds Movement
Record funds movement to gather the impact of the incident and organize recovery efforts.
- Original address that held the funds
- Transaction that moved the funds
- Assets and amounts the funds are comprised of
- Destination the funds moved to (Contract, CEX, Bridge, Mixer)
- Recovery Status of the funds

Use Phalcon Tx Explorer to aid in recording funds movement.

| Origin | Transaction | Amount / Asset | Destination | Recovery Status | Notes |
| ------ | ----------- | -------------- | ----------- | --------------- | ----- |
|        |             |                |             | Needs Review    |       |
|        |             |                |             | In Progress     |       |

### Attacker Information
Gather attacker information to aid legal efforts and fund recovery.

| Address Link | Funded By | Notes |
| ------------ | --------- | ----- |
|              |           |       |
|              |           |       |
|              |           |       |

## Post Incident Actions
1. Confirm the incident has been resolved.
2. Create monitoring alerts for situations requiring future actions.
3. Prepare scripts to perform any actions related to monitoring events in the future.
4. Consider creating additional defensive scripts (pause/upgrade) to use for future situations.
5. Schedule a Post Mortem writeup.
6. Post the writeup to relevant social media.
