# Whitehat Safe Harbor

tag: [SEAL/Initiative, Protocol, Whitehat]

The Whitehat Safe Harbor initiative is a framework in which protocols can offer legal protection to whitehats who aid in the recovery of assets during an active exploit.

## How does it work?

SEALâ€™s [Whitehat Safe Harbor](https://github.com/security-alliance/safe-harbor) agreement is a legal and technical framework which can be adopted by protocols and crypto communities to grant advanced permission to whitehats and MEV bots for frontrunning exploits so long as:

1. Funds are returned to a designated Asset Recovery Address determined by the protocol.
2. Action is only taken in the event of an Active Exploit.

By adopting Safe Harbor, protocols and whitehats can work together to increase their chances of recovering funds in the event of an attack.
