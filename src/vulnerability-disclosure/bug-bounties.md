# Bug Bounties

Bug bounty programs incentivize security researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities in your project. They are an essential component of a comprehensive security strategy, especially in the Web3 space where security is paramount. Depending what the scope is, you may have a higher success rate having certain parts at different types of bug bounty as a service providers as they generally have security researchers with different skill sets using their platforms.
