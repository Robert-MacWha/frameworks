# Google Workspace Security

Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) is a powerful suite of productivity and collaboration tools widely used by projects. Ensuring the security of Google Workspace is critical for protecting sensitive information, maintaining compliance, and preventing unauthorized access.

## Account Security

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **Enable MFA**: Require all users to enable multi-factor authentication for their Google Workspace accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification in addition to the password.
- **Use Hardware Tokens**: Encourage the use of hardware tokens (e.g., Yubikeys) for MFA instead of SMS, which is more vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks.

### Strong Password Policies
- **Enforce Strong Passwords**: Implement policies requiring strong, complex passwords that are regularly updated.
- **Password Manager**: Encourage the use of password managers to generate and store unique passwords for each account.

## Access Management

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Define Roles**: Implement RBAC to ensure users have access only to the information and applications necessary for their job roles.
- **Regular Access Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews of user permissions to ensure access levels are appropriate and revoke access for users who no longer need it.

### Least Privilege Principle
- **Minimize Access**: Ensure users have the minimum level of access necessary to perform their duties.
- **Temporary Access**: Use Just-In-Time (JIT) access controls to grant temporary access when needed and automatically revoke it after a specified period.

## Data Protection

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- **Implement DLP Policies**: Set up DLP policies to monitor and protect sensitive information from being shared outside the organization or to unauthorized users.
- **Content Scanning**: Use DLP to scan emails and documents for sensitive content and enforce policies to prevent data leakage.

### Encryption
- **Encrypt Emails**: Use Google Workspace's built-in encryption features to protect emails in transit.
- **Drive Encryption**: Ensure that files stored in Google Drive are encrypted both in transit and at rest.

## Monitoring and Alerts

### Activity Monitoring
- **Audit Logs**: Enable and regularly review audit logs to track user activities, such as login attempts, file access, and administrative changes.
- **Security Center**: Use the Google Workspace Security Center to monitor security metrics, detect potential threats, and receive alerts for suspicious activities.

### Incident Response
- **Alert Configuration**: Set up alerts for unusual activities, such as multiple failed login attempts, suspicious file sharing, and changes to security settings.
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an [incident response plan](../incident-management/README.md) specific to Google Workspace, detailing the steps to be taken in the event of a security breach.

## Device Management

### Mobile Device Management (MDM)
- **Enforce MDM Policies**: Use Google Workspace's MDM features to enforce security policies on mobile devices, such as requiring screen locks, enabling encryption, and remotely wiping data if a device is lost or stolen.
- **Device Inventory**: Maintain an inventory of all devices accessing Google Workspace and regularly audit to ensure compliance with security policies.

## Communication and Collaboration

### Secure Sharing
- **Controlled Sharing**: Set policies to control sharing of files and documents within and outside the project. Use link sharing settings that restrict access to only specific people.
- **Shared Drives**: Use shared drives for team collaboration with appropriate access controls and permissions.

### Email Security
- **Spam and Phishing Protection**: Enable advanced spam and phishing protection features to filter out malicious emails.
- **Secure Communication Channels**: Encourage the use of secure communication channels for sensitive discussions, such as Google Chat with end-to-end encryption.

## Compliance and Governance

### Compliance Settings
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Configure Google Workspace to comply with relevant regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR) by using compliance tools and settings.
- **Policy Enforcement**: Use Google Workspace Admin Console to enforce security policies and ensure compliance with project and regulatory standards.
