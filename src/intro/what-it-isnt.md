# What it isn't
This isn't just a compilation of resources. At first glance, it may seem that way because writing
that amount of content is a process by itself. However, there are already skilled curators creating
content with that kind of structure.

Curations, compilations, and blog posts are fine, but they often focus on the latest technologies
rather than delving into specifics, the underlying concepts, and the technical aspects.

This isn't something to be read like a "story," at least not until we understand where it leads and
if the community is satisfied with the outcome. We still need to figure out how to improve the
content structure and determine what the web3 community needs most.

It may not always follow the current state of the art, since its focus won't at the technologies,
that would make the content very hard to maintain, but you'll get an idea of what things are
possible in given situations.

And definitely, this is not intended to be offensive, though it might include some offensive
material to illustrate our point in some particular topics.
