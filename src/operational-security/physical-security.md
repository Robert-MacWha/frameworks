# Physical Security

Physical security is an often overlooked but crucial aspect of operational security, especially for individuals and organizations involved in cryptocurrency. This section provides guidelines on how to protect yourself, your digital assets, and your organization from physical threats and attacks.

## Secure Traveling

### Preparation
- **Minimal Devices**: Travel with the minimum number of devices necessary. Leave non-essential devices at home.
- **Data Backup**: Backup all important data before traveling. Store backups in secure, separate locations.
- **Clean Devices**: Remove sensitive data from devices before traveling. Consider using travel-specific devices with minimal data depending on the country you're visiting.

### During Travel
- **Device Security**: Keep your devices with you at all times. Use secure storage options when necessary.
- **Public Wi-Fi**: Avoid using public Wi-Fi networks. If necessary, use a VPN to secure your connection.
- **Untrusted Chargers**: Avoid using untrusted charging stations. Use a USB data blocker or carry a portable charger.

### Border Security
- **Encryption**: Encrypt your devices to protect data in case they are inspected or seized.
- **Minimal Data**: Carry minimal data across borders. Be aware that some countries may require decryption of devices.
- **Preparation for Inspection**: Be prepared for device inspections. Consider using travel-specific accounts and removing sensitive information.

## Preventing "Wrench Attacks"

A "wrench attack" refers to the scenario where an attacker uses physical force or coercion to gain access to your assets.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Multi-Signature Wallets**: Use multi-signature wallets that require multiple parties to authorize transactions.
- **Distributed Keys**: Distribute parts of cryptographic keys among trusted individuals or locations.
- **Decoy Wallets**: Use decoy wallets with small amounts of cryptocurrency to satisfy attackers without compromising significant assets.
- **Security Policies**: Establish clear policies for responding to physical threats in your project, including non-compliance and emergency contacts.

## Home Security

- **Physical Barriers**: Use strong locks, security doors, and window bars to prevent unauthorized entry.
- **Surveillance**: Install security cameras and alarm systems. Monitor the premises regularly.
- **Secure Storage**: Use safes or locked cabinets to store devices and sensitive documents.

## Device Protection

### Hardware Security
- **Physical Locks**: Use laptop locks and secure your devices to immovable objects when in public or shared spaces.
- **Tamper-Evident Seals**: Use tamper-evident seals on devices to detect unauthorized access attempts.
- **Regular Checks**: Regularly check devices for signs of tampering or unauthorized access.

### Environmental Considerations
- **Temperature Control**: Protect hardware wallets or other devices from extreme temperatures, humidity, and physical shocks.
- **Fire Safety**: Store hardware wallets or other important devices in fire-resistant safes and ensure that your environment has appropriate fire detection and suppression systems.

## Emergency Contacts
Maintain a list of emergency contacts, including law enforcement, cybersecurity experts, and organizational contacts.
