# Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
tag: [Engineer/Developer, Security Specialist]

Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) is a security testing method that involves evaluating applications in their running state. DAST tools simulate attacks against the application to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

## Benefits of DAST

1. **Real-World Testing**
   - Tests applications in their real-world operational state, identifying vulnerabilities that static analysis might miss.

2. **Broad Coverage**
   - Detects a wide range of vulnerabilities.

3. **No Access to Source Code Required**
   - Can be performed without access to the application's source code.

## Best Practices for DAST

1. **Automate Scanning**
   - Integrate DAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan applications during development and deployment.

2. **Regular Testing**
   - Perform regular security testing on running applications to identify new vulnerabilities introduced by code changes.

3. **Comprehensive Coverage**
   - Ensure that all parts of the application, including APIs and web services, are tested.

4. **Use Multiple Tools**
   - Use multiple DAST tools to increase coverage and improve detection accuracy.
