# Code Signing

- Require PRs to be signed with the user’s GPG key.
- Every PR before going to your stable/main/master branch is reviewed by another core team member.
- Require MFA to be enabled on all users where applicable and available (Github, Email, …). Hardware MFA should be encouraged (e.g. Yubikeys), as MFA through SMS has more attack vectors.
