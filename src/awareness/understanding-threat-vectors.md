# 2. Understanding Threat Vectors

## 2.1. Social Engineering & Phishing Awareness

### 2.1.1. Recognizing Tactics:

- **Phishing Emails:**
Look for red flags like misspellings, odd URLs, and urgent language.
**Scenario Example:** An email that claims "Your account will be locked in 24 hours" but uses a suspicious domain.

- **SMS & Messaging Scams:**
Attackers may use text messages or direct social media messages to bypass email filters.
**Scenario Example:** A text message that claims to be from a delivery service asking for a confirmation code.

- **Voice Phishing (Vishing):**
Phone calls that pretend to be from a trusted organization, often using spoofed caller IDs.
**Scenario Example:** A staff member receives a voicemail warning about a potential security breach and instructing them to call a specific number immediately. Recognizing the urgency and verifying the caller ID against known numbers can help avoid falling for a vishing scam.

### 2.1.2. Additional Social Engineering Techniques:

- **Pretexting:**
Attackers create a fabricated scenario to steal personal information or gain access.
**Scenario Example:** Someone pretending to be a new contractor who needs urgent access to systems or information.

- **Baiting:**
Offering something enticing to entrap the victim.
**Scenario Example:** Leaving infected USB drives in public places or offering free downloads that contain malware.

- **Tailgating:**
Physically following authorized personnel into restricted areas without proper credentials.
**Scenario Example:** An unknown person following an employee through a secure door by claiming they forgot their access card.

- **Shoulder Surfing:**
Observing someone's screen, keyboard, or device to gather information.
**Scenario Example:** A threat actor monitoring your screen in a shared co-working space to capture sensitive information or credentials.

## 2.2 Common Indicators & Red Flags

### 2.2.1. Behavioral Cues

- **Inconsistencies:**
Look for changes in tone or style in communications from known contacts.
**Scenario Example:** A normally formal manager sends a casual message with unexpected requests.

- **Unusual Requests:**
Requests for urgent transfers of money, sensitive information, or changes in process should always trigger caution.

- **Environmental Anomalies:**
Spotting unexpected logins or unfamiliar devices in account activity reports can indicate compromised accounts.

### 2.2.2. Checklist Example

- Does the message contain spelling errors or unusual formatting?
- Is the sender's email or username slightly different from the norm?
- Are there requests for urgent action without proper verification channels?

**Scenario Example:** During a routine check, an employee notices a login from a foreign location that they don't recognize. Reporting this anomaly promptly could prevent unauthorized access.

## 2.3 Preventive Measures Against Social Engineering

### 2.3.1. Verification Practices

- **Double-Check Requests:**
Always verify the identity of individuals requesting sensitive information, especially if the request is unusual or urgent.
**Scenario Example:** If you receive an email from your CEO asking for an urgent wire transfer, call them directly using a known phone number to confirm.

- **Use Secure Channels:**
Communicate through official channels and avoid sharing sensitive information over unsecured methods.
**Scenario Example:** Use your organization's established communication platforms rather than responding to external email links.

### 2.3.2. Security Controls

- **Access Control:**
Implement strict access control measures, preferably requiring confirmations by multiple people before critical actions can be taken.
**Scenario Example:** Requiring two-person authorization for significant financial transactions or system changes.

- **Report Suspicious Activity:**
Encourage team members to report any suspicious behavior or requests immediately.
**Scenario Example:** Create a simple reporting process that doesn't penalize false positives to encourage vigilance.

### 2.4. Education and Awareness

- **Regular Training:**
Conduct regular training sessions on recognizing and responding to social engineering attacks.
**Scenario Example:** Monthly security newsletters highlighting recent attack techniques relevant to your organization.

- **Stay Current:**
Keep up to date on the current trends in social engineering attacks.
**Scenario Example:** Be aware that threat actors are increasingly pretending to provide jobs and asking applicants to run malicious projects that create backdoors on the applicant's computer.
