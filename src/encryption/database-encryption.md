# Database Encryption

Database encryption protects sensitive information stored in databases. Implement the following best practices:

## Best Practices

- **Encrypt Data at Rest**: Use strong encryption algorithms to encrypt database files and backups.
- **Column-Level Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive columns within the database, such as those containing personally identifiable information (PII).
- **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**: Use TDE to automatically encrypt and decrypt data stored in the database.
- **Key Management**: Implement robust key management practices, including the use of HSMs and regular key rotation.
- **Access Controls**: Enforce strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted data.

By following these practices, you can secure sensitive data stored in databases and protect it from unauthorized access.
