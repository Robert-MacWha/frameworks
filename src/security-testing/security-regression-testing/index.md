Security regression testing involves retesting previously fixed vulnerabilities to ensure that they remain fixed and that new code changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities.

## Benefits of Security Regression Testing

1. **Ensures Consistency**
   - Verifies that security fixes remain effective and are not inadvertently undone by subsequent code changes.

2. **Maintains Security Posture**
   - Helps maintain the overall security posture of the application by continuously monitoring for regressions.

3. **Automates Verification**
   - Automates the process of verifying security fixes, reducing the need for manual retesting.

## Best Practices for Security Regression Testing

1. **Automate Testing**
   - Integrate security regression testing into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically test code changes for regressions.

2. **Maintain Test Cases**
   - Maintain a comprehensive set of test cases that cover known vulnerabilities and common security issues.
   - Regularly update test cases to reflect new vulnerabilities and changes in the codebase.

3. **Use Version Control**
   - Use version control systems to track changes to test cases and ensure that they are up to date.
   - Implement automated checks to verify that changes to the codebase do not introduce regressions.

4. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Continuously monitor the results of security regression tests to identify and address regressions promptly.
