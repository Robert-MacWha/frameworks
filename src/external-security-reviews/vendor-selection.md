# Vendor Selection

Choosing the right security vendor is critical for your protocol’s safety and success. Consider these key points when selecting a security vendor:

## Varying Degrees of Expertise and Quality
- Evaluate potential vendors based on their track record, reputation, and the depth of their security knowledge.
- Look for vendors with a proven history of addressing security challenges similar to your protocol’s needs.

## Ensure Relevant Domain Experience
- Ensure the vendor has relevant experience in web3 security vulnerabilities, as these require specialized skills.
- For example, if you’re building an L2, choose vendors with a track record of reviewing similar platforms.

## Combine Traditional and Community Assessments
- An ideal security assessment program should include both traditional security reviews and community-driven assessments.
- Traditional security firms provide structured evaluations, while community audits leverage the power of the crowd to identify vulnerabilities.

## Don't Forget Bug Bounties
- Implement bug bounty programs to incentivize external security researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities.
- Bug bounties help uncover issues that might go unnoticed in traditional testing and provide an additional layer of security.

## Success or Failure?
- Avoid making the scope too large. Focus on critical components to ensure a thorough and manageable review.
- Start with a crowd-sourced assessment, move to a vendor review for focused analysis, and then implement a bug bounty program to catch any remaining issues.

By carefully selecting a security vendor, you can ensure a thorough and effective security assessment for your protocol.
