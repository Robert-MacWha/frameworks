# Expectation

A security review is a time-boxed assessment of your smart contracts and web3 protocol, with the goal of finding as many vulnerabilities as possible and educating the development team on ways to improve the security of their codebase moving forward. Security reviewers use a combination of manual techniques and automated tools to identify vulnerabilities affecting the target.

Key points to expect from a security review:
- Identification of security vulnerabilities and potential exploits.
- Recommendations for mitigating identified risks.
- Education on secure coding practices for future development.
- Comprehensive report detailing findings and suggested improvements.

By setting clear expectations, you can maximize the benefits of the security review and enhance your project's security posture.
