# Repository Hardening

Hardening your code repository is vital to protect against unauthorized access and ensure the integrity of the codebase. Implement the following best practices:

- **Enforce MFA**: Require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all repository members.
- **Protected Branches**: Enable protected branches to prevent unauthorized changes to critical branches. [Learn more about protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches).
- **GitHub Security Hardening**: Follow the [Security hardening for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions) to avoid token stealing and other vulnerabilities.
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to limit who can push to critical branches and repositories.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits of the repository to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
- **Commit Signing**: Require all commits to be signed to verify the identity of contributors and ensure the integrity of the code.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update dependencies and use tools to check for and manage vulnerabilities in dependencies.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly enhance the security of your code repository.
