# Security Testing

Security testing is a crucial part of the DevSecOps process, ensuring that vulnerabilities are identified and addressed early.

- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)**: Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to analyze source code for vulnerabilities.
- **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Use DAST tools to test running applications for security issues.
- **Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)**: Combine SAST and DAST approaches with IAST tools for comprehensive security testing.
- **Fuzz Testing**: Implement fuzz testing to discover security vulnerabilities by inputting random data into the system.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration testing to identify and exploit potential security weaknesses.

Effective security testing helps in proactively identifying and fixing vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
