# Key Terms

## Active Exploit

Active Exploits (or, in the legal contract, an “_Urgent Blackhat Exploit_”), are defined in the Safe Harbor Agreement (_2.3 Certain Defined Terms, Urgent Blackhat Exploits_). Summarizing, an exploit is considered to be active when:

1. The exploit has already been initiated against a Protocol and remain an active threat; or
2. The exploit that is highly likely to be imminently initiated against a Protocol.

In general, this means an _active exploit_ is one that is already in progress, where perusing regular reporting methods such as a bug bounty wouldn’t be fast enough to protect protocol funds.

## Safe Harbor Registry

An Asset Recovery Address is an on-chain address that is created by a protocol prior to their Safe Harbor adoption. This address is used by Whitehats to return funds to a protocol after successfully intervening during an active exploit under Safe Harbor. Protocols must create this address on every chain for which they have assets under scope. The address should be highly secure and able to handle large sums of assets.

## Asset Recovery Address

The Safe Harbor registry is an on-chain smart contract that helps protocols adopt Safe Harbor. The smart contract allows protocols to register their adoption details and legally adopt Safe Harbor, publicly displaying information such as the Assets under Scope, Asset Recovery Address, Bounty Terms, and more.

The contract’s source code and deployment details are stored in the [security-alliance/safe-harbor](https://github.com/security-alliance/safe-harbor) GitHub repository.
