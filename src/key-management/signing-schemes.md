# Signing schemes
*TODO: add images and technical reproducible examples.* 

## Externally Owned Accounts (EOA)
**Analogy:** Like a traditional house key. One key opens the lock (account).  
**Control:** Single key operation.  
**Use:** Basic transactions and smart contract interactions.  
**Security:** Single point of failure if key is compromised.

## Multisignature (Multisig)
**Analogy:** Like a bank locker needing two or more keys to open.  
**Control:** Requires multiple keys for actions.  
**Use:** Common in organizational settings for shared control.  
**Security:** Reduces risk with distributed key management.

## Smart Contract Wallets (Safes)
**Analogy:** Like a programmable safe where rules for opening can be set.  
**Control:** Wallets as programmable contracts.  
**Use:** Advanced features like rules for transactions.  
**Security:** Customizable, potentially more secure.

## Threshold Signatures
**Analogy:** Similar to a vault that opens only when a certain number of authorized staff turn their keys simultaneously.  
**Control:** Group-based, with a minimum number needed for action.  
**Use:** Efficient and private alternative to multisig.  
**Security:** Reduces risk while maintaining group control.

## Social Recovery Wallets
**Analogy:** Like a group of friends who can vouch for you to regain access to a locked house.  
**Control:** Recovery managed by trusted contacts.  
**Use:** User-centric approach to account recovery.  
**Security:** Community-based security model.

## Delegated Signing/Proxy Contracts
**Analogy:** Like giving a trusted friend a spare key to handle certain tasks at your home in your absence.  
**Control:** Delegation of authority to another account or contract.  
**Use:** Automation and complex operations.  
**Security:** Depends on delegate's security practices.

## Account Abstraction (AA)
**Analogy:** Like a shape-shifting lock, where the way it opens can change over time.  
**Control:** User accounts as smart contracts.  
**Use:** Complex rules and operations for transactions.  
**Security:** Flexible, potentially higher security models.
