# Community Management
Managing online communities on platforms such as Twitter (X), Discord, or Telegram demands a proactive approach to security. To help safeguard and protect your community, here are some best practices:

- **Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    - Use unique, complex passwords for each service, managed through a password vault.
    - Enable 2FA. Avoid SMS-based 2FA due to its vulnerability to SIM-swapping attacks. Use hardware-based tokens like Yubikey or a mobile application. Do not use your password manager to generate 2FA codes; separate passwords and 2FA codes.
    - On Telegram, enable “Two Step Verification” for added security when accessing your account from a new device.
    - For 2FA apps like Authy, encrypt your passcodes with a password to prevent unauthorized access through SIM-swapping.
    - Secure the email account associated with your community accounts with unique passwords and 2FA (preferably hardware-based).
    - Encourage community members to adopt these security practices.
    - Regular password changes are unnecessary if you follow these recommendations.

- **Account Verification:**
    - Apply for Twitter's blue check mark to establish authenticity. Remove your phone number after verification for added security.
    - Verify your Discord server to confirm its legitimacy.

- **Permissions and Roles:**
    - On Discord, manage server roles and permissions carefully. Restrict access to sensitive channels or features to trusted individuals who follow best security practices. Refer to Discord’s best practice document: [Securing Your Server](https://discord.com/community/securing-your-server).
    - Regularly review and update permissions as your community evolves.

- **Moderation and Reporting Tools:**
    - Use built-in moderation tools on all platforms to maintain a positive and safe community environment.
    - Train your moderation team to use these tools effectively.

- **Phishing Awareness:**
    - Educate community members about phishing scams and how to recognize them.
    - Remind them never to share sensitive information, such as login credentials or personal data.
    - Be cautious with QR codes, especially on Discord, as they can be used to hijack accounts through phishing.

- **Regular Backups:**
    - Regularly back up important data, conversations, and server configurations on Discord.
    - Consider saving crucial tweets and data offline from Twitter.

- **User Education:**
    - Continuously educate community members about online security best practices.
    - Provide resources and guidelines for them to follow.

- **Operational Security:**
    - Be aware of the risk of your computer or phone being compromised, which could lead to your community services being compromised. Take steps to minimize this risk according to your risk appetite.

- **Emergency Response Plan:**
    - Prepare an emergency response plan for security breaches or unexpected incidents. Having a compromised account could lead to severe consequences as more users may fall for scams.
    - Know how to report and respond to security threats promptly.
    - Be prepared. Consider the saying: “It’s not a question of **if** you’ll have a breach, but **when**.” Planning ahead can help mitigate chaos.

By implementing these best practices for community management on Twitter, Discord, and Telegram, you can create a safer and more secure online environment for your community members while protecting their digital assets and your own reputation.
