# What is it
A collection of best practices, written in an abstract or general fashion, for you to apply them
regardless the technology.

If not, you can consider it a sort of large guide to start securing everything you have and be
resilient with lesser chances of getting rekt.

This is the result of the incentive to centralize existing information, so you probably won't see
many novelistic features to it, but it will likely be the first time you see all of them together.

Expect security-related topics, from simpler ones to more complex ones. Most recent attacks focus on
ignorance. The stakes are too high, and even having all the knowledge in the world won't help us
prevent things like the xz backdoor.

We hope this resource helps you take your current knowledge to another level.

May your security consciousness expand.
