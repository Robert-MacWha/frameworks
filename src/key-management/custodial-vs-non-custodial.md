# Custodial vs NonCustodial
*TODO: Add an image and more technical examples.*

## Custodial Wallets
**Analogy**: Like a bank. The service provider (like a bank or an exchange) holds your crypto keys.
**Control**: The provider controls your keys, managing transactions and security.
**Access**: You access funds through their interface (web/app).
**Risk**: If the provider gets hacked, your assets might be at risk.
**Recovery**: Easier to recover access if you lose your login details.

## Non-Custodial Wallets:
**Analogy**: Like a personal safe. Only you have the key (private key).
**Control**: You have full control over your keys and crypto assets.
**Access**: Direct interaction with the blockchain via software/hardware wallet.
**Risk**: If you lose your key, no one can recover your assets.
**Responsibility**: Higher security responsibility on your part.
