# Community Management
Managing online communities on platforms such as Twitter (X), Discord or Telegram demands a proactive approach to security. To help safeguard and protect your community, here are some best practices:

- **Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    - Do not reuse passwords across services, instead use a password vault that can generate complex unique passwords for each service.
    - Enable 2FA. This ensures that even if your password is compromised, unauthorized access is less likely. **Do not use SMS based 2FA**, as it is prone to SIM-swapping attacks and there have been multiple instances of accounts being compromised via SMS based 2FA. If you at some point have added your phone number to Twitter, you should remove it as have previously proved to be a way for attackers to reset account access even though users also had hardware-based 2FA assigned to their accounts. Hardware-based tokens such as Yubikey are recommended, and if not available use a mobile application. It is not recommended to use your password manager/vault to generate 2FA codes, as it’s recommended to separate passwords and 2FA codes.
    - Telegram has a feature called “Two Step Verification” where you’ll need to input an additional password in order to obtain access to your account after setting up a new device.
    - If you use a 2FA application such as Authy on your phone for 2FA, remember to create a password to encrypt your passcodes otherwise, it’s possible to SIM-swap your phone number in order to obtain all your 2FA codes to the accounts you have added to Authy.
    - Secure the email account you have used to sign up in the same way as your community accounts; unique passwords and 2FA (preferably hardware-based).
    - Do not reuse passwords across services, instead use a password vault that can generate unique passwords for each service.
    - Encourage community members to do the same and educate them on password security.
    - There’s no need to change your passwords periodically if you’ve managed to follow previous recommendations.
- **Account Verification:**
    - Twitter offers a blue check mark. Consider applying for verification to establish authenticity and build trust within your community. One caveat is that in order to apply, you must first add your phone number. As per the suggestions in “Strong Passwords and Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)” section, it is recommended to remove the phone number after being verified.
    - Discord allows server verification. Consider verifying your server to confirm its legitimacy.
- **Permissions and Roles:**
    - In Discord, carefully manage server roles and permissions. Restrict access to sensitive channels or features only to trusted individuals who have secured their own accounts according to best practices. Discord has created a best practice document available here: https://discord.com/community/securing-your-server
    - Regularly review and update permissions as your community evolves.
- **Moderation and Reporting Tools:**
    - Leverage built-in moderation tools on both platforms to maintain a positive and safe community environment.
    - Educate and train your moderation team on using these tools effectively.
- **Phishing Awareness:**
    - Educate your community members about phishing scams and how to recognize them.
    - Remind them to never share sensitive information, such as login credentials or personal data, with anyone.
    - Some applications such as Discord allow you to log on to a new device by scanning a QR code with your phone. Be aware that people may attempt to obtain access to your account by getting you to scan such QR codes, often with false claims of free premium features or similar scams.
- **Regular Backups:**
    - Regularly back up important data, conversations, and server configurations on Discord.
    - Twitter content is usually stored on Twitter's servers, but consider saving crucial tweets and data offline.
- **User Education:**
    - Continuously educate your community members about online security best practices.
    - Provide resources and guidelines for them to follow.
- **Operative Security**
    - Be aware that the computer or phone you use to manage the community may be compromised which in turn could lead to your community services being compromised, and you should take steps to minimize the risk of that happening as per your risk appetite.
- **Emergency Response Plan:**
    - Prepare an emergency response plan in case of a security breach or unexpected incidents. Having a compromised community account could have severe consequences as more users will fall for a scam created by a compromised account.
    - Know how to report and respond to security threats promptly.
    - Be prepared. There is a common saying in web2; “it’s not a question **if** you’ll have a breach, the question is **when** it happens.”, so it’s important to think about what to do ahead of time to lower the risk of chaos ensuing.

By implementing these best practices for community management on Twitter. Discord and Telegram, you can create a safer and more secure online environment for your community members while protecting their digital assets and your own reputation.
