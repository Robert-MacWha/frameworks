# Supply Chain Security

Supply chain security is a critical aspect of ensuring the integrity and security of software projects. It involves managing and securing all the components, dependencies, and processes involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of software. In the context of blockchain and web3 projects, supply chain security could be even more vital due to the potential financial impacts.

This section covers key aspects of supply chain security, including dependency awareness and supply chain levels for software artifacts. By implementing best practices and leveraging the right tools, projects can help mitigate risks and enhance the overall security of their software supply chain.
