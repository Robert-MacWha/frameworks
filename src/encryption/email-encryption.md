# Email Encryption

Email is insecure and unencrypted by default, but can become more secure by following best practices:

## Best Practices

1. Implement S/MIME or PGP to encrypt email messages and attachments.
2. Train project members on how to use email encryption tools.
3. Use only trusted email gateways to protect incoming and outgoing email communications.
4. Ensure that emails are transmitted over TLS-encrypted connections.
