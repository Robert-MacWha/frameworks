# Playbooks

Incident response playbooks provide detailed, step-by-step procedures for handling specific types of security incidents. They help ensure a consistent and efficient response, reducing the impact of incidents and accelerating recovery.

## Key Elements of an Incident Response Playbook

- **Incident Description**: Define the type of incident the playbook addresses (e.g., stolen funds, data breach, DDoS attack).
- **Detection and Analysis**: Outline the steps for detecting and analyzing the incident, including key indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tools to use.
- **Containment**: Describe immediate actions to contain the incident and prevent further damage.
- **Eradication**: Provide detailed steps for eradicating the root cause of the incident.
- **Recovery**: Outline procedures for restoring systems and data to normal operation.
- **Post-Incident Activities**: Detail the steps for conducting a post-incident review and capturing lessons learned.
