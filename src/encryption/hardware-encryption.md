# Hardware Encryption

Hardware encryption uses dedicated hardware to encrypt data, providing robust security.

## Best Practices

- **Use Encrypted Drives**: Use self-encrypting drives (SEDs) for storage to ensure data is encrypted at the hardware level.
- **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)**: Use HSMs to securely generate, store, and manage encryption keys.
- **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**: Use TPMs to enhance the security of hardware-based encryption.
- **Firmware Updates**: Regularly update firmware to ensure hardware encryption devices are protected against vulnerabilities.
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls to prevent unauthorized physical access to hardware encryption devices.
