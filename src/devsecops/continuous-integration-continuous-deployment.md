# Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are critical for maintaining code quality and ensuring rapid, secure software delivery. Implement the following best practices:

- **Automated Testing**: Ensure every PR undergoes CI testing (e.g., GitHub Actions) before merging. CI tests should include unit tests, integration tests, and checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- **Configuration and Credential Checks**: The CI/CD pipeline should check for misconfigurations and leaked credentials.
- **Deterministic Builds**: Produce deterministic builds with a strict set of dependencies and/or a build container that can reliably produce the same results on different machines.
- **Security Scanning**: Integrate security scanning tools to detect vulnerabilities in code and dependencies during the CI process.
- **Isolated Environments**: Use isolated environments for building and testing to prevent contamination between different stages of the pipeline.
- **Access Controls**: Implement strict access controls for CI/CD pipelines to limit who can modify the pipeline configurations.

These practices ensure a secure, efficient, and reliable CI/CD process.
