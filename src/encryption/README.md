By understanding and applying the principles of encryption, you can protect your data across different platforms and use cases, enhancing overall security.

## General Best Practices

- **Use Strong Algorithms**: Always use industry-standard encryption algorithms such as AES-256.
- **Manage Keys Securely**: Implement robust key management practices, including the use of hardware security modules (HSMs) if relevant to your project and regular key rotation.
- **Encrypt Sensitive Data**: Ensure that all sensitive data is encrypted both at rest and in transit.
