# Guidelines for On-Chain Monitoring

Effective on-chain monitoring involves setting up systems and processes to continuously observe blockchain activities and detect any anomalies. Here are some best practices for implementing robust on-chain monitoring for your project.

## Best Practices

### Define Monitoring Objectives
- **Identify Key Metrics**: Determine the critical metrics to monitor, such as large fund transfers, token minting events, and changes in contract ownership.
- **Set Clear Goals**: Define what you aim to achieve with monitoring, such as early detection of security breaches or compliance with regulatory requirements.

### Implement Monitoring Tools
- **Automated Tools**: Use automated monitoring tools that can continuously track blockchain activities and generate alerts for anomalies.
- **Manual Reviews**: Supplement automated tools with periodic manual reviews to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Establish Alerting Mechanisms
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Set up real-time alerts to notify relevant project members of any suspicious activities or threshold breaches.
- **Alert Channels**: Use multiple channels for alerts, such as email, SMS, and messaging apps where available, to ensure timely response.

### Regular Reviews and Updates
- **Periodic Audits**: Conduct regular reviews of your monitoring systems to ensure they are functioning correctly and covering all necessary metrics.
- **Update Thresholds**: Regularly update thresholds and alert configurations based on the evolving threat landscape and project changes.

### Incident Response
- **Incident Response Plan**: Develop and maintain an [incident response plan](../incident-management/README.md) to handle alerts and anomalies promptly.
