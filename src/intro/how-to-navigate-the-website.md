# How to navigate the website (WIP)
You will see there are different categories. Right now we're currently under the introduction,
but below there's a bigger category which we will refer to it as "Frameworks". Each framework is
inside a broader category as you already noticed. 

But something interesting you can do, is filter by profile. What does "filter by profile" mean? It means that you can possibly be a community manager, or a developer, and might only be interested in the parts you can relate to your current role or position under an organization. So how do you do to remove what would be unnecesary reading? Simply head to the search bar, and filter by any of the following roles:
- developer
- executive
- security
- finance
- crypto
- management
- community
- non-technical
