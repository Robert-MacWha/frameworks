# Introduction to the frameworks
Welcome to The Red Guild Safety Handbook, a curated resource for those seeking
knowledge in the realm of blockchain security, particularly within the Ethereum
ecosystem. Our guild, a collective of dedicated security researchers, is on a
mission to spread awareness and educate the community about best practices and
potential pitfalls.


We have noticed a growing need to address the various challenges and issues
facing our field, some of which include a lot of security threats that are not
specifically aimed at web3 infraestructure. Recognizing that information is
abundant but not always easily accessible, we've taken it upon ourselves to
compile and organize existing resources from around the internet, as well as
generating new specifically with this purpose in mind.

Regardless of your background, be it web2, web3, or beyond, this handbook is
open to all who seek to learn and contribute. Our problem, or rather our
passion, is sharing knowledge, and we've found a way to do so despite our
limited resources and time constraints.

This mdBook-style handbook is designed for easy collaboration and automatic deployment through
continuous integration. If you'd like to join our effort, feel free to fix typos, contribute new
sections, or propose enhancements. Simply fork [this
repository](github.com/theredguild/safety-book), switch to `develop` branch and submit a pull
request. You can also click on the upper-right corner, which will take you to suggest an edit using
GitHub's web interface.

## Who We Are
The Red Guild is a non-profit organization committed to enhancing security awareness, education, and
specialized work as a public service for the Ethereum ecosystem and its supporting technologies and
communities. Our efforts are driven by a shared desire to foster a safer, more informed digital
landscape.

Let's work together to make a difference!
