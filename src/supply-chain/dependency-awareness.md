# Dependency Awareness

Dependency awareness is the practice of understanding and managing all the external libraries, frameworks, and components that a software project relies on. Dependencies can introduce vulnerabilities and risks, making it crucial to keep track of them and ensure they are secure.

## Importance of Dependency Awareness

1. **Security Risks**
   - Dependencies can contain vulnerabilities that may be exploited by attackers. Keeping track of dependencies helps in identifying and mitigating these risks.

2. **Compliance**
   - Ensuring that dependencies comply with licensing and regulatory requirements is essential to avoid legal issues.

3. **Maintainability**
   - Understanding dependencies and their impact on the project helps in maintaining and updating the software more effectively.

## Best Practices for Dependency Awareness

1. **Use Dependency Management Tools**
   - Leverage tools that can automatically track and manage dependencies. Examples include:
     - **Web2:**
       - **Snyk:** Monitors and fixes vulnerabilities in dependencies.
       - **Dependabot:** Automatically updates dependencies in GitHub projects.
     - **Solidity:**
       - **Ethlint:** Analyzes and lints Solidity code, including dependencies.
       - **MythX:** Scans for vulnerabilities in smart contract dependencies.

2. **Regularly Update Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions. Use automated tools to help manage updates and patches.

3. **Monitor for Vulnerabilities**
   - Continuously monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk, npm audit, and GitHub Security Alerts.

4. **Audit Dependencies**
   - Perform regular audits of dependencies to ensure they are necessary and secure. Remove unused or outdated dependencies.

5. **Use Trusted Sources**
   - Only use dependencies from trusted and reputable sources. Avoid using unverified or poorly maintained libraries.
