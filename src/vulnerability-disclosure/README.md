# Vulnerability Disclosure


Vulnerability disclosure is the task that is done after a vulnerability has been identified and fixed, and means to make the vulnerability known to the larger public. Often, a vulnerability disclosure will come after a [bug bounty](./bug-bounties.md) report has been filed and the vulnerability has been corrected, or from a team member that noticed a vulnerability which was then fixed. In the event that responsible disclosure of the vulnerability is not possible because the vulnerable code is actively or will imminently be exploited, [Safe Harbor](./safe-harbor/index.html) may be applicable.
