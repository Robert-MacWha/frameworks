# Web Application Security

Providing a secure front-end (web application) for users to interact with your web3 protocol is essential. Web application vulnerabilities have been exploited in the past to steal user funds. Follow these best practices to secure your web application:

## Best Practices

- **Use Battle-Tested Frameworks**: Utilize popular and well-maintained web application frameworks such as React ([useDApp](https://usedapp.io/)), Angular (TypeScript), AngularJS, Vue, or ExpressJS.
- **Understand Common Vulnerabilities**: Familiarize yourself with common web application vulnerabilities such as:
    - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
    - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
  Refer to the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) for a comprehensive list.

- **Limit Custom Components**: Minimize the introduction of custom components in your framework. Ensure that any custom code undergoes thorough internal and external security testing.
- **Ensure High Availability**: Refer to the [Infrastructure/DDoS Protection](../infrastructure/ddos-protection.md) section for insights on ensuring high availability of your protocolâ€™s front-end.
- **Secure Back-End Access**: Lock down access to associated back-end services, such as S3 buckets, to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Deploy on IPFS**: Consider deploying additional versions of your front-end on IPFS to ensure availability and resilience.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly reduce the risk of web application vulnerabilities and enhance the security of your front-end.
