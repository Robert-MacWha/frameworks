# Standard Operating Environment (SOE)

A Standard Operating Environment (SOE) refers to a standardized and controlled computing environment used across a project. It ensures that all devices and systems adhere to the same security policies, configurations, and software versions, thereby reducing vulnerabilities and simplifying management. Implementing an SOE is a crucial aspect of operational security, particularly for projects handling sensitive information or digital assets.

## Key Components of an SOE

### Device Configuration

- **Full-Disk Encryption**: Ensure all workstations and mobile devices use full-disk encryption to protect data at rest.
- **Operating System Updates**: Configure devices to automatically apply critical security patches and updates.
- **Application Updates**: Ensure all installed applications are regularly updated to their latest versions to mitigate vulnerabilities.

### User Access Controls

- **Least Privilege Principle**: Grant users the minimum level of access required to perform their job functions. Avoid using administrative accounts for day-to-day activities.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to manage permissions and access based on user roles within the organization.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for accessing sensitive systems and data. Use hardware tokens (e.g., Yubikeys) for the highest level of security.

### Security Software

- **Anti-Malware Protection**: Install and maintain anti-malware software on all devices where relevant. Ensure it is configured to automatically update and scan regularly.
- **Firewall Configuration**: Enable and configure local firewalls on all devices where applicable to control inbound and outbound network traffic.

### Data Management

- **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest. Use strong encryption standards and manage encryption keys securely.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement regular backup procedures for all critical data. Ensure backups are encrypted and stored securely offsite or in the cloud. Regularly test recovery processes to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Classification**: Classify data based on sensitivity and implement appropriate handling and storage procedures for each classification level.

### Network Security

- **Secure Network Configuration**: Segment networks to limit access to sensitive systems where applicable. Use virtual LANs (VLANs) and firewalls to enforce segmentation.
- **VPN Usage**: Require the use of VPNs for remote access to the organization's network. Ensure VPNs use strong encryption protocols.
- **Wi-Fi Security**: Secure wireless networks using WPA3 or WPA2 with AES encryption. Regularly update Wi-Fi passwords and manage access to authorized devices only.
