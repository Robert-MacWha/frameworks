As of 2025-01-19 Decap CMS is used because of its support for editorial workflows, login
without git accounts, and arbitrary static site generators. In the future we should consider
switching to sveltia because of it's more active develompment, near-full compatability with decap,
better UX, and non-reliance on netlify's identity system.
