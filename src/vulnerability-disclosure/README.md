# Vulnerability Disclosure

Vulnerability disclosure is a critical aspect of maintaining the security and integrity of a Web3 project, which augments a security team and audits. It involves the processes and practices for identifying, reporting, and addressing security vulnerabilities. Properly managing vulnerability disclosure helps protect users, preserve trust, and ensure the ongoing security of your project.
