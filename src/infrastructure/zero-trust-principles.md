# Zero-Trust Principles

The Zero-Trust security model assumes that threats can exist both inside and outside the network. It requires strict verification for every user and device attempting to access resources, regardless of their location.

## Key Principles

- **Verify Explicitly**: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device health, and service or workload.
- **Use Least Privilege Access**: Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.
- **Assume Breach**: Segment networks and use encryption to limit the potential impact of a breach.

## Implementation Strategies

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Implement strong IAM practices, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies.
- **Network Segmentation**: Use micro-segmentation to create secure zones in data centers and cloud environments.
- **Endpoint Security**: Ensure all endpoints (e.g., devices, servers) comply with security policies before granting access.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring and analytics to detect and respond to anomalies in real-time.
- **Security Automation**: Use automation to enforce security policies consistently across the network.

By adopting Zero-Trust principles, you can enhance the security posture of your project and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.
