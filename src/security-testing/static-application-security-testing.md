# Static Application Security Testing (SAST)


Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is a method of analyzing source code for security vulnerabilities without executing the program. SAST tools examine the codebase to identify potential security issues, enabling developers to address vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.

## Benefits of SAST

1. **Early Detection**
   - Identifies security vulnerabilities early in the development process, reducing the cost and effort required to fix them.

2. **Comprehensive Analysis**
   - Provides a detailed analysis of the codebase, uncovering vulnerabilities that might be missed during manual reviews.

3. **Automated Scanning**
   - Automates the process of security analysis, providing consistent and repeatable results.

## Best Practices for SAST

1. **Integrate into CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code changes for vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure that all code is scanned before it is merged into the main branch.

2. **Regular Scanning**
   - Perform regular security scans on the codebase to identify new vulnerabilities introduced by code changes.

3. **Prioritize Findings**
   - Prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity and potential impact.
   - Focus on fixing critical and high-severity issues first.

4. **Provide Developer Training**
   - Provide training for developers on how to interpret SAST results and fix identified vulnerabilities.
   - Encourage secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced.
