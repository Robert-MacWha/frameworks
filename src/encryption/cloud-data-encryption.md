You should consider using the best practises below, in order to ensure that data stored in the cloud is protected from unauthorized access:

## Best Practices

1. Use strong encryption algorithms.
2. Ensure data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
3. Use cloud provider-managed keys or even better bring your own keys (BYOK) for enhanced control over encryption keys.
4. Implement strict access controls and monitoring to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted data.
5. Continually review that the encryption best practises are being followed everywhere it's relevant.
