# Vulnerability Disclosure
tag: [Engineer/Developer, Security Specialist]

Vulnerability disclosure is the task that is done after a vulnerability has been identified and fixed, and means to make the vulnerability known to the larger public. Often, a vulnerability disclosure will come after a bug bounty report has been filed and the vulnerability has been corrected, or from a team member that noticed a vulnerability which was then fixed.
