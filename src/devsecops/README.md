# DevSecOps
Conventional development methodologies frequently prioritize swift project deployment over security considerations. This trend is particularly prevalent in the realm of blockchain projects, where developers often race against time to outpace competitors or capitalize on industry hype.

As the adoption of blockchain continues to grow across various industries, so does the need to safeguard the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of blockchain-based systems and applications. To address these challenges effectively, integrating security into the development and operations processes is crucial. This is where **DevSecOps** comes into play.

**DevSecOps**, an amalgamation of "Development," "Security," and "Operations," represents a shift in the way we approach cybersecurity within software development and deployment. Unlike traditional approaches where security considerations often come as an afterthought, DevSecOps advocates for the seamless integration of security practices throughout the entire software development lifecycle (***SDLC***). This approach fosters a proactive security mindset, prioritizing automation and promoting collaboration among development, security, and operations teams.
