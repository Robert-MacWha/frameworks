# Encryption in Transit

Encryption in transit protects data as it moves across networks. Implement the following best practices:

## Best Practices

- **Use TLS/SSL**: Ensure that all data transmitted over the internet is encrypted using TLS/SSL.
- **Secure VPNs**: Use secure VPNs to encrypt data transmitted over public networks.
- **SSH for Remote Access**: Use SSH for secure remote access to servers and other infrastructure.
- **Email Encryption**: Use encryption protocols such as S/MIME or PGP for email communications.
- **Monitoring and Logging**: Monitor and log network traffic to detect and respond to potential security threats.

These practices help ensure that data remains confidential and secure during transmission.
